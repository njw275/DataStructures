For any positive integer if its even divide by two and if its odd multiply by three and add 1.\
In my opinion, it looks as though it\'92ll diverge but it converges. Eventually, you will reach a power of 2 going through these steps, and therefore it can terminate to 1 by dividing by 2 until it terminates. }
